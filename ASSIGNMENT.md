# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> Figuring out what other people's code is doing is significantly harder than writing the code yourself. 
reply.js has a very well documented API, and even with that, it was still hard to figure out
exactly what was going on in the code. By far the hardest portion of this assignment was decyphering 
the author's intent. Although its important to note that good documentation did make it a lot easier. 

If I could change one thing about the process would be the lengthy amount of time it takes to set everything
up. There are always so many problems with just getting all the "basics" in place. For example, I had to create 
am index-text.js file instead of just executing the index.js file, that took a while to figure out because it wasnt
clearly explained. Also, there was a bug in the code provided, it was missing a comma, so when it was all set up it
wasn't compiling. My first thought was that it was an error in my set up process since that's the most novel aspect
of the whole thing, it took a long time for me to move away from the assumption that the author's code was 
correct. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Once you speak the language you're coding in, the code itself is communicating things very litererally. 
"Raising a level of abstraction" is moving a level away from this literalness, and it's an essential
process to being able to communicate what the program does. Reading through the code you will understand
how it executes, reading through the comments you will know what each portion does, and reading through
the header comments and the Readme will tell you why it does it and for what purpose overall.

If I had to explain to a new 142 student how to write an effective comment it would be to exclude functionality
details, focus on abstration, and explain each process while avoiding technical terms. The reason is so that
a layman can understand what the code is doing in each part without having to understand the mechanics of the
code itself. Also it allows for the code to be modified without the comment needing to be (assuming the modifications
are superficial like changing a variable type or something). If you use technical descriptions in your commenting
you have to change out the comments too. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 10 hours approx. Most of it was in setting up and comprehending the code the first time.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
>Isabella Spaletta, she helped me figure out how to set up reply.js by letting me know that it runs from an 
index-text.js file that I build and not an index.js file that's provided. She also let me know about the missing
comma in the source code that caused the error. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Reply.js has a missing comma in the source code. Reply also doesn't specify that you execute the program from the command line, 
but that you use a seperate index.js file that you make and name, not the one provided. Also, the code itself was very dense, a lot of advanced
javascript language that I wouldn't have expect our level of .js skill to encapsulate.
